# Autonomous Job Search & Auto-Apply AI Agent

A **fully autonomous, policy-constrained** system that searches jobs, personalizes applications, and applies at scale — safely and truthfully.

---

## Overview

This project is a hands-free job application agent for students.

It:
- Builds a facts-only student artifact pack
- Matches and ranks relevant jobs
- Generates grounded, job-specific personalization
- Automatically submits applications
- Tracks success, failures, and retries

No fabricated credentials.  
No uncontrolled automation.

## Core Components

- **Artifact Pack Generator (`/analyze`)**  
  Resume, GitHub, LinkedIn, and portfolio ingestion into a single source of truth.

- **Job Matching & Ranking (`/match-jobs-ai`)**  
  AI-based semantic matching, skill overlap scoring, and automatable job filtering.

- **Auto-Personalization (`/generate-short-notes-from-queue`)**  
  Recruiter notes grounded strictly in student evidence.

- **Sandbox Auto-Apply (`/sandbox-apply-batch`)**  
  Fully autonomous submission with safety gates and outcome tracking.

## Safety & Autonomy

- `automation_allowed` hard gate  
- Match score thresholds  
- Grounded personalization only  
- Failure handling and retries  

Autonomy is enforced in code, not prompts.
